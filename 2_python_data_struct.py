# Objective: This assignment is designed to enhance your understanding and application of Python's core data structures - tuples, lists, and dictionaries - in real-world contexts. By engaging with these tasks, you will practice manipulating these data structures, applying built-in Python methods, and implementing error handling in practical situations.

# Task 1: Library System Enhancement Sharpen your skills in managing and modifying data within tuples and lists.

# Problem Statement: You are maintaining a library system where each book is stored as a tuple within a list. Your task is to update this system by adding new books and ensuring no duplicates.

# Existing Library Data:

library = [("1984", "George Orwell"), ("Brave New World", "Aldous Huxley")]

def add_book(library, new):
    if new in library:
        print ("This book is already in the libtrary.")
    else:
        library.append(new)
        print("Book added!")
